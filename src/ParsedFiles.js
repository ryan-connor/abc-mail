Alice’s Evidence\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\n\n\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n“without pictures or conversations?”\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\ndeep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n"

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\nof my undertaking.\n\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\n\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\n\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\nwhose effusion"

In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\nhabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\nthe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\ndetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\nperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\nunknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\nunequally at birth.\n\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\nwet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded\non. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\nthe world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\nexempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\n“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\nromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\nall right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\nfloated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\nWestern city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\nclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of\nBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s\nbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\nWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\ncarries on today.\n\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\nfather’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\na century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\ndelayed"

These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest\nlivelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg\nsustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn\nthieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight\nfor the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.\n\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\nchildren in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their\nmothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable\nstate of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore\nwhoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these\nchildren sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so\nwell of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of\nthe nation.\n\nBut my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for\nthe children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and\nshall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are\nborn of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who\ndemand our charity in the streets.\n\nAs to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this\nimportant subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our\nprojectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\ncomputation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be\nsupported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:\nat most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\ncertainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\nbegging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide\nfor them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their\nparents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of\ntheir lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding,\nand partly to the clothing of many thousands.\n\nThere is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\nprevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women\nmurdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,\nsacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence\nthan the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\ninhuman breast.\n\nThe number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\nand a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred\nthousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract\nthirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children,\n(although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present\ndistresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a\nhundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand,\nfor those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or\ndisease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty\nthousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore\nis, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have\nalready said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly\nimpossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither\nemploy them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I\nmean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a\nlivelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where\nthey are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments\nmuch earlier; during which time they"

To reveal art and\nconceal the artist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate\ninto another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful\nthings.\n\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.\nThose who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without\nbeing charming. This is a fault.\n\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the\ncultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom\nbeautiful things mean only beauty.\n\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well\nwritten, or badly written. That is all.\n\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing\nhis own face in a glass.\n\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban\nnot seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of\nthe subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in\nthe perfect use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove\nanything. Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has\nethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable\nmannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express\neverything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an\nart. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the\npoint of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the\nsurface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their\nperil. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.\nDiversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,\ncomplex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with\nhimself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he\ndoes not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that\none admires it intensely.\n\nAll art is quite useless.\n\nOSCAR WILDE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\nsummer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\nthe open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\nperfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\n\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\n\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\nstrange conjectures.\n\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smil"

LANYON’S NARRATIVE\n\n HENRY JEKYLL’S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\n\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was\nnever lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\nlovable. At friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste,\nsomething eminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which\nnever found its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these\nsilent symbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in\nthe acts of his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he\nwas alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the\ntheatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had\nan approved tolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with\nenvy, at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and\nin any extremity inclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to\nCain’s heresy,” he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the\ndevil in his own way.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune\nto be the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in\nthe lives of downgoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came\nabout his chambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept\nhis friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that\nwas the lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those\nwhom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the\ngrowth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\nthe well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what\nthese two could see in each other, or what subject they could find in\ncommon. It was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday\nwalks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail\nwith obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two\nmen put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief\njewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\nuninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what is\ncalled quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in\ncoquetry; so that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an\nair of invitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday,\nwhen it veiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of\npassage, the street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood,\nlike a fire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters,\nwell-polished brasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note,\ninstantly caught and pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on\nthe panels; chil"

It could hardly have been more violent,\nindeed, had he burned down the Custom-House, and quenched its last\nsmoking ember in the blood of a certain venerable personage, against\nwhom he is supposed to cherish a peculiar malevolence. As the public\ndisapprobation would weigh very heavily on him, were he conscious of\ndeserving it, the author begs leave to say, that he has carefully read\nover the introductory pages, with a purpose to alter or expunge\nwhatever might be found amiss, and to make the best reparation in his\npower for the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty. But it\nappears to him, that the only remarkable features of the sketch are\nits frank and genuine good-humor, and the general accuracy with which\nhe has conveyed his sincere impressions of the characters therein\ndescribed. As to enmity, or ill-feeling of any kind, personal or\npolitical, he utterly disclaims such motives. The sketch might,\nperhaps, have been wholly omitted, without loss to the public, or\ndetriment to the book; but, having undertaken to write it, he\nconceives that it could not have been done in a better or a kindlier\nspirit, nor, so far as his abilities availed, with a livelier effect\nof truth.\n\nThe author is constrained, therefore, to republish his introductory\nsketch without the change of a word.\n\n    SALEM, March 30, 1850.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n                               CONTENTS.\n\n\n                                                PAGE\n\nTHE CUSTOM HOUSE.—INTRODUCTORY                     1\n\n\n                          THE SCARLET LETTER.\n\nI.

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\n\n\nI.\n\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\n\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\n\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\nand looked me over i"
